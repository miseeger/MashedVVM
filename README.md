MashedVVM
==========

!!! This project is currently a work-in-progress so be aware that it's in ALPHA-State and not ready for production !!!

MashedVVM is a very, very lightweight MVVM framework that brings an 'INotifyable' data class and 
abstract ViewModel base classes plus an also abstract View base class. There are also Interfaces 
provided which are implemented in those classes to have them ready-to-use in an IoC scenario 
(like PRISM with Unity). It is stricly limited to WPF and it supports the ViewModel-First paradigm.

The library combines ideas from other MVVM libraries like AtomicMVVM, Jounce, MVVM Foundation with
some ideas from lessons learned in a couple of video tutorial sessions and WPF specialized books.
