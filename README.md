MashedVVM
==========

!!! This project is currently a work-in-progress so be aware that it's in ALPHA-State and not ready for production !!!

MashedVVM is a very lightweight MVVM framework that brings an 'INotifyable' data class and 
abstract ViewModel base classes plus an also abstract View base class. There are also Interfaces 
provided which are implemented in those classes to have them ready-to-use in an IoC scenario 
(like PRISM with Unity).
